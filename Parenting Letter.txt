Parenting Letter

Dear Brother,

I have been studying the implications of the New Testament principles and commands taught by Jesus and His Apostles as they relate to child rearing.  Recently, a brother speaking before the church said, "beat your children into submission with severity."  I fear that the church has strayed from the narrow path of peacemaking, nonviolence, and gentleness as it relates to the treatment of children by their Christian parents.  In preparing the way for the kingdom of God, John the Baptist commanded to "do violence to no man" or to "intimidate no one". (Luke 3:14).  In the same way that marriage to another while one's spouse lives is always adultery and violates the marriage covenant, so also is corporal punishment a violation of the nonviolence principle and the commands of Jesus.  This means that spanking, slapping, or any other form of physical pain purposely inflicted as a punishment or under the guise of "discipline" is off-limits to Christians.

In the same way that killing an innocent person is always murder (even if the victim is an unborn child and the act called "abortion"), so also is corporal punishment a violation of the nonviolence principle and the commands of Jesus (even if the victim is a child and the act called "discipline").

There are no exceptions to the commands of Jesus, even relating to children. Especially relating to children!  Jesus in His Sermon on the Mount commanded us to be meek, righteous, merciful, pure, peacemakers.  Jesus abolished eye-for-eye and tooth-for-tooth punishments when he commanded us to "turn the other cheek". (Matthew 5:38-39).  We must "bless them that curse [us]" (Matthew 5:44), especially if our own children curse us.  We must "forgive men their trespasses" (Matthew 6:14-15), especially if our own children do wrong.
Matthew 5:38-39: "Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."

Jesus told us to "love your enemies, do good to them" (Matthew 5:44) -- how much more, then, must we love and do good to our own children?  Asking "who is my enemy?" assuming that children wouldn't be included in those commands is no different than the man asking Jesus, "who is my neighbor?", seeking to justify himself.  Jesus commanded his disciples to "have love one to another" (John 13:35); the Holy Spirit says love is patient and kind and is not provoked and does not impute evil (1 Corinthians 13:4-5).  In short, love "beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things." (1 Corinthians 13:7).  Spanking or hitting a child is the antithesis of love as defined by the Holy Spirit in 1 Corinthians 13.  Using a rod is not love nor is it gentle or meek: 1 Corinthians 4:21: "What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"

As followers of Jesus, we must demonstrate the fruit of the spirit in all circumstances.  Galatians 5:22-23: "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."  Inflicting corporal punishment is inherently contrary to longsuffering and gentleness, and is also contrary to peace, meekness, and temperance in at least some circumstances.  Theologian David Ericson said, "While there are more than 25 commands to be kind, gentle, compassionate, understanding, forgiving, and empathetic, there are exactly zero commands to be harsh, to hit (spank), to yell at, coerce, manipulate, shame, or control children."

Jesus gave an example of an ideal earthly father in his parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15.  That father is endlessly patient and instantly forgiving.  He never punishes his sons for their sins against him but rather deals with them according to mercy, wisdom, reason, and understanding.

In the New Testament era, God's people are not permitted to punish anyone nor to coerce anyone to do anything by force.  Jesus abolished physical punishment by God's people when he said, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone." (John 8:7).  A Christian is permitted to take adverse action only in keeping no company with so-called Christians living in sin (Corinthians 5:11, 2 Thessalonians 3:14); this does not apply in any parenting situation.  In Romans 12:17-19, we are commanded never to repay evil for evil, always to live peaceably with all, and never to avenge ourselves but leave all vengeance to God.  Punishment often is deferred until the day of judgment which gives those sinning maximum opportunity to repent: 2 Peter 2:9: "The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"

Parents are required to discipline their children, but discipline is not punishment.  Discipline is discipleship as in teaching, instructing, nurturing, correcting, training, and reconciliation.  This discipline should be "gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children." (1 Thessalonians 2:3,7).  We must "exhort and comfort and charge" our children "That [they] would walk worthy of God, who hath called [them] unto his kingdom and glory." (1 Thessalonians 2:11-12).  Twice, we fathers are cautioned by Paul to continuously monitor our children's emotional states and moods and anticipate their next state of mind; we are told not to exasperate or discourage them and not to incite them to anger or to wrath (Ephesians 6:4, Colossians 3:21).  We must "bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." (Ephesians 6:4).  When our child is caught in some fault, we must "restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness" (Galatians 6:1).

Putting this New Testament discipline into practice includes planning ahead to address potential "misbehavior" before it ever starts.  For example, we ensure our children are fed before they are overly hungry and put them to bed before they are overtired.  We do not expose them to situations for which they are unprepared, and we refrain from ridiculing them for not meeting standards they have not yet developmentally achieved.  Before a new situation, we discuss our expectations with our children, as they may not know what is required in that situation.  While the child is still young, the responsibility for his behavior rests entirely with the parent.  As the child grows in wisdom and developmental capability, he will take more responsibility and require less guidance and planning from his parents.

There is much more to be said on the topic, but I implore you to consider the ramifications of all of Jesus's commands in the context of raising children.  Please consider the grave concern about improper treatment of children in contrast to being gentle as commanded by the Holy Spirit.  "What not to do" should be abundantly clear: do not practice nor tolerate physical violence against children even the form known as "spanking" that is often called "discipline".  "What to do instead" is a longer journey and discussion, but requires recognizing the problem first.  Doing the right thing will be a difficult path but will have its reward.  I'm happy to have discussions or provide helpful resources on the topic; I've been learning so much on the topic of peaceful parenting and I still have much more yet to learn.  It's an exciting journey I'd love to share with you!

The following pages include brief answers for a few questions and objections I had when starting this journey, as well as scripture quotations alluded to above.

Your brother in Christ,

James

Wisdom in parenting involves knowing which behaviors to address and which ones to let go. Not every obnoxious behavior requires immediate intervention. When a child exhibits undesirable behavior, the first step is for parents to reflect on their own actions and responses. Up to around age five, a child's behavior is often a direct reflection of the environment the parent has created. If children are overactive, rude, or engaging in dangerous activities, it is essential for parents to consider how the home environment may be influencing these behaviors. Parents must ask themselves what changes they can make to foster a more positive atmosphere.

Discerning when to intervene and when to let go is a crucial part of the rewarding journey of child-rearing. For instance, if a child repeatedly disobeys, it raises the question of escalation: what happens when the maximum disciplinary action has been taken, yet the lesson remains unlearned? Even if spanking seems effective in the short term, as children grow, they may begin to view the pain as merely a "cost of doing business." This raises concerns about the long-term effectiveness of such methods and the potential for children to become desensitized to physical punishment.

Practically, there are countless ways to approach parenting, and it is vital to be child-centric. Instead of primarily engaging with adults and ignoring children until they misbehave, parents should actively participate in their children's lives. For example, when preparing for a new situation, such as attending a group meeting, parents can discuss expectations with their children in advance. This proactive approach helps children understand what to expect and reduces anxiety, allowing for a smoother transition into new environments.



In addition to understanding and communication, effective parenting also involves recognizing the importance of emotional readiness in children. Parents should be attentive to their children's moods and developmental stages, ensuring that they are not placed in situations that may overwhelm them. For instance, if a child is feeling anxious or tired, it may be wise to adjust plans or leave an event early rather than insisting they stay in an uncomfortable environment. This flexibility not only demonstrates empathy but also reinforces the idea that their feelings are valid and important.

Furthermore, fostering a child-centric approach means actively involving children in discussions about their behavior and expectations. Role-playing scenarios can be a valuable tool for helping children navigate new experiences. By practicing how to respond in various situations, children can build confidence and develop problem-solving skills. This method encourages children to express their thoughts and feelings, creating an open dialogue that strengthens the parent-child relationship and promotes a sense of security.



To effectively guide children's behavior and manage difficult situations, parents can engage in proactive conversations that set clear expectations and provide strategies for handling challenges. For instance, before going to a busy event, a parent might say, "We're going to a party today, and it might get loud and crowded. If you start to feel overwhelmed, remember to take deep breaths and find a quiet spot with me. If you feel like you want to run around, let’s agree on a few times when you can play freely." Additionally, if a child is struggling with sharing toys during playdates, a parent could say, "I noticed you had a hard time sharing your toys today. Next time, let’s practice taking turns together. You can say, 'Can I have a turn when you’re done?' This way, your friends will know you want to play too." These conversations not only help children understand appropriate behavior but also equip them with tools to navigate social interactions and manage their emotions effectively.



Does the New Testament ever describe a father violently punishing his son?
There is only one New Testament passage that might hint at violence done to a son but it is neither a command nor is it describing a human father.  Hebrews 12:6 says God "scourges every son whom he receives".  This is not permission for human fathers to scourge their own children any more than God taking vengeance gives Christians permission to take vengeance. In fact, Christians are explicitly forbidden from taking vengeance in Romans 12.
Hebrews 12:6: "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."


What is discipline?
Many Christians have misunderstood discipline to mean punishment when it has much more to do with discipleship as in teaching, instructing, nurturing, and correcting.  Practically, discipline includes leading by example and demonstrating correct behavior.

It is clear that fathers "chasten" or "discipline" their sons. (Most of the newer literal translations say "discipline" versus "chasten".) Fleshly fathers are called "correctors". Discipline is unpleasant in the moment and not fun, but it leads to righteousness.

What is chastisement or chastening or discipline (G3809)? The same word is translated "instruction" as in "instruction in righteousness" in 2 Timothy and also translated "nurture" as in "nurture and admonition of the Lord" in Ephesians. These are the only two New Testament occurrences of this word outside of Hebrews 12.
2 Timothy 3:16: "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:"
Ephesians 6:4: "And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."

What is "chastened" or "chasteneth" or "disciplined" or "disciplining" (G3811)? Elsewhere it's translated as "learned", "taught", "instructing", "teaching":
"learned"
Acts 7:22: "And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds."
"taught"
Acts 22:3: "I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day."
"learn"
1 Timothy 1:20: "Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
"instructing"
2 Timothy 2:25: "In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;"
"teaching"
Titus 2:11-12: "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;"

The word translated "corrector" (G3810) in Hebrews 12 is found only one other place in the New Testament where it's translated "instructor".
Romans 2:20: "An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law."

Nothing in the Hebrews 12 passage implies any permission at all for parents to practice corporal punishment of young children, much less command it. "Discipline", yes; "spank", no.
Hebrews 12:7-11: "If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."


Doesn't Hebrews say that discipline should be painful?
Hebrews 12:11: "Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."
This can be summarized as, "Discipline is unpleasant in the moment and not fun, but it leads to righteousness."

Children certainly dislike having to humble themselves and apologize when they've wronged a sibling. They feel disappointment and perhaps shame when their failings are discussed with them, especially when the failing was in direct contradiction to a parental request. Children feel sad if their lack of self-control results in some items being placed out of their reach, whereas before those same items were accessible, conditioned upon asking for permission first.

Discipline shouldn't include pain purposely inflicted, though. In rare circumstances, there could be physical discomfort from fatigue due to having to clean up a big mess that the child himself created.

The term "grievous" or "sorrow" (G3077) usually refers to something other than physical pain.  It is frequently contrasted with joy or rejoicing (John 16:20,22, 2 Corinthians 2:3, Hebrews 12:11).  It is something that fills a heart or is felt in one's heart (John 16:6, Romans 9:2).  It is a disposition with which one can approach another (2 Corinthians 2:1).  One can give grudgingly or cheerfully (2 Corinthians 9:7).  Paul feels sorrow when someone else is ill (Philippians 2:26-27).  The only instance where physical pain accompanies the sorrow is the woman giving birth, where afterward she has "joy that a man is born into the world."

Depending on the translation, the phrase in Hebrews 12:11 is rendered "not joyous but grievous", "not of joy but of sorrow", and in some others even "not pleasant but painful", but it doesn't indicate physical pain. G3077 is defined as "sorrow, pain, grief, annoyance, affliction. of persons mourning." This looks like an emotional pain not physical. In KJV, G3077 is almost always translated "sorrow" (11 times) but twice as "heaviness", and once each as "grief", "grievous", and "grudging".


What is obedience?
The Greek word "obey" G5219 as in "obey your parents" means listen, attend to, or hearken; this is a voluntary compliance, never coerced.  The corresponding Hebrew word H8085 means to listen earnestly, to give attention to, and to consider and respond.  Proverbs 19:20 describes future wisdom as the reason to obey or listen to counsel. Ezekiel 4 shows an example when Ezekiel was neither chastized nor punished for refusing to obey God's command; instead, God gave a modified command, which Ezekiel obeyed happily.  Jesus said that delayed obedience following outright defiance still counts as obedience in Matthew 21. Obedience of children should demonstrate and be practiced within a loving trusting relationship.  Parents are never commanded to extract compliance or force their children to obey.


What about the Proverbs "rod passages"?
Even ignoring the implications of Jesus saying, "but I say unto you," and, "turn the other cheek," the "child" referred to in Proverbs is a sexually-mature young man; modern translations better translate the Hebrew word H5288 "na'ar" as "youth" to show this age distinction.  Even if taken literally, these Proverbs passages about the rod cannot be literally applied to young children as is widely practiced within the church as "spanking" and any other form of corporal punishment; if it could be applied to anyone, it would be to older boys who have reached the age of puberty.

Raw Material:



Wisdom is knowing what to let go and what to correct.  Not every obnoxious behavior is something to be corrected.  The first place to look is yourself when the child is doing what you don't like; you can change only yourself.  Below a certain age, the child's behavior is a direct behavior of the environment that a parent has provided. The parent is responsible for that environment up about age five, then less and less after that.  The child's behavior builds upon the prior environment that the parent has built.

My kids are overhyper, rude, doing dangerous things, not doing their homework. Remember that their behavior is entirely a reflection of where you've placed them; the first thing to look back to is yourself.  What can you change or what have you been doing to cause the behavior?

The child's behavior is 1. developmental stage (all babies cry), or 2. it's a reflection of what the parents have created (provided or not provided)

Discerning when to intervene and when to let go is part of the delightful journey of child rearing.

[It means not exposing them to situations they are not prepared for. Not ridiculing them for failing to fulfil a certain standard that they have not developmentally achieved yet.]

[When they're going to be in a new situation, you talk to them ahead of time what is expected of them; they won't know the expectations of them from a new situation if they haven't done it before.]



Moving forward, we're told to raise our children in meekness and not to lord it over them.  The parenting principle is that we don't use violence against our children.  We are welcome and required to use as much kindness, gentleness, patience, meekness in our parenting approach with as much creativity as we can muster.  New principle is that you don't get to hit your kids and you get to treat them nicely.  "How do I solve these problems without spanking?" implies that spanking has not solved those problems.

Have your children ever disobeyed more than once? Had the same issue multiple times? The escalation problem. What happens when you reach the max force and the lesson still hasn't been learned?  Even if spanking seems to work when the child is very young, as he grows he becomes more capable of shrugging off the pain as "cost of doing business."  What do you do when the boys start getting bigger and try to fight back?

Cost of doing business.  Don't get caught.

Hebrews 4, law not able to give a clean conscience or make you righteous. It can't make you want to do things or to do things; it can only make you want to avoid being punished.


Practically, there are as many ways of doing it as there are parents.  Be child-centric; instead of chatting it up w/ the adults and ignoring the children until they "misbehave", be with your children and let the adults fend for themselves.


[Examples of talking to your child about XYZ thing, talking through an exchange w/ a child. For mental practice in relating to the child. Role play examples.]

Child comes home and is very sad after school.  I ask about his feelings.  Discussion back and forth.  OR

We need to go to a group meeting, but this is the first time I'm taking my child to bible study b/c no one is available for childcare.  We hurriedly leave home right after dinner. I throw her in the car.  When showing up, I put her in the corner w/ toys as I head off to be part of the singing.

Since this has never happened before, and I know days in advance that this could happen and that she might be startled by the new environ, I start explaining to her 3 days early, I explain that "usually on Wednesdays you do XYZ but not today because..." "so you're actually going to come to this study with me.  there will be other people there and I expect you do do XYZ. If you find it confusing, come to me and tell me about the confusion." make sure to leave 40 minutes early and get used to the environment.  She can sit on my lap instead of being put w/ toys alone in a corner.

typical vs good examples

An example that shows what it'd look like that clearly illustrates you don't "just give the child whatever she wants"

Include an example of leaving early when it's not working out for the child.
