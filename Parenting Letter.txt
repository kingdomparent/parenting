Parenting Letter

Dear Brother,

I have been studying the implications of the New Testament principles and commands taught by Jesus and His Apostles as they relate to child rearing.  I fear that the church has strayed from the narrow path of peacemaking, nonviolence, and gentleness as it relates to the treatment of children by their Christian parents.  In preparing the way for the kingdom of God, John the Baptist commanded to "do violence to no man" or to "intimidate no one".  In the same way that marriage to another while one's spouse lives is always adultery and violates the marriage covenant, so also is corporal punishment a violation of the nonviolence principle and the commands of Jesus.  This means that spanking, slapping, or any other form of physical pain purposely inflicted as a punishment or under the guise of "discipline" is off-limits to Christians.

In the same way that killing an innocent person is always murder (even if the victim is an unborn child and the act called "abortion"), so also is corporal punishment a violation of the nonviolence principle and the commands of Jesus (even if the victim is a child and the act called "discipline").

There are no exceptions to the commands of Jesus, even relating to children. Especially relating to children!  Jesus in His Sermon on the Mount commanded us to be meek, righteous, merciful, pure, peacemakers.  Jesus abolished eye-for-eye and tooth-for-tooth punishments when he commanded us to "turn the other cheek".  We must "bless them that curse [us]", especially if our own children curse us.  We must "forgive men their trespasses", especially if our own children do wrong.
Matthew 5:38-39: "Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."

Jesus told us to "love your enemies, do good to them" -- how much more, then, must we love and do good to our own children?  Asking "who is my enemy?" assuming that children wouldn't be included in those commands is no different than the man asking Jesus, "who is my neighbor?", seeking to justify himself.  Jesus commanded his disciples to "have love one to another"; the Holy Spirit says love is patient and kind and is not provoked and does not impute evil.  In short, love "beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things." (1 Corinthians 13:7).  Spanking or hitting a child is the antithesis of love as defined by the Holy Spirit in 1 Corinthians 13.  Using a rod is not love nor is it gentle or meek: 1 Corinthians 4:21: "What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"

As followers of Jesus, we must demonstrate the fruit of the spirit in all circumstances.  Galatians 5:22-23: "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."  Inflicting corporal punishment is inherently contrary to longsuffering and gentleness, and is also contrary to peace, meekness, and temperance in at least some circumstances.  Theologian David Ericson said, "While there are more than 25 commands to be kind, gentle, compassionate, understanding, forgiving, and empathetic, there are exactly zero commands to be harsh, to hit (spank), to yell at, coerce, manipulate, shame, or control children."

Jesus gave an example of an ideal earthly father in his parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15.  That father is endlessly patient and instantly forgiving.  He never punishes his sons for their sins against him but rather deals with them according to mercy, wisdom, reason, and understanding.

In the New Testament era, God's people are not permitted to punish anyone nor to coerce anyone to do anything by force.  Jesus abolished physical punishment by God's people when he said, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone."  The only sense in which a Christian is permitted to execute any kind of punishment is in keeping no company with so-called Christians living in sin as described in 1 Corinthians 5 and 2 Thessalonians 3:14.  In Romans 12:17-19, we are commanded never to repay evil for evil, always to live peaceably with all, and never to avenge ourselves but leave all vengeance to God.  Punishment often is deferred until the day of judgment which gives those sinning maximum opportunity to repent: 2 Peter 2:9: "The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"

Parents are required to discipline their children, but discipline is not punishment. Discipline has everything to do with discipleship as in teaching, instructing, nurturing, and correcting.  This discipline should be "gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children."  We must "exhort and comfort and charge" our children "That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory."  Twice, we fathers are cautioned to continuously monitor our children's emotional states and moods and anticipate their next state of mind.  Putting it into practice would include planning ahead to subvert "misbehavior" before it ever starts, such as making sure they're fed before they're over-hungry and getting them to bed before they're over-tired.  We must "bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."  When our child is caught in some fault, we must "restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness."

There is much more to be said on the topic, but I implore you to consider the ramifications of all of Jesus's commands in the context of raising children.  Please consider the grave concern about improper treatment of children in contrast to being gentle as commanded by the Holy Spirit.  "What not to do" should be abundantly clear: do not practice nor tolerate physical violence against children even under the guise of "discipline" or "spanking".  "What to do instead" is a longer journey and discussion, but requires recognizing the problem first.  Doing the right thing will be a difficult path but will have its reward.  I'm happy to have discussions or provide helpful resources on the topic; I've been learning so much on the topic of peaceful parenting and I still have much more yet to learn.  It's an exciting journey I'd love to share with you!

The following pages include brief answers for a few questions and objections I had when starting this journey, as well as scripture quotations alluded to above.

Your brother in Christ,

James



Does the New Testament ever describe a father violently punishing his son?
There is only one New Testament passage that might hint at violence done to a son but it is neither a command nor is it describing a human father.  Hebrews 12:6 says God "scourges every son whom he receives".  This is not permission for human fathers to scourge their own children any more than God taking vengeance gives Christians permission to take vengeance. In fact, Christians are explicitly forbidden from taking vengeance in Romans 12.
Hebrews 12:6: "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."


What is discipline?
Many Christians have misunderstood discipline to mean punishment when it has much more to do with discipleship as in teaching, instructing, nurturing, and correcting.  Practically, discipline includes leading by example and demonstrating correct behavior.

It is clear that fathers "chasten" or "discipline" their sons. (Most of the newer literal translations say "discipline" versus "chasten".) Fleshly fathers are called "correctors". Discipline is unpleasant in the moment and not fun, but it leads to righteousness.

What is chastisement or chastening or discipline (G3809)? The same word is translated "instruction" as in "instruction in righteousness" in 2 Timothy and also translated "nurture" as in "nurture and admonition of the Lord" in Ephesians. These are the only two New Testament occurrences of this word outside of Hebrews 12.
2 Timothy 3:16: "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:"
Ephesians 6:4: "And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."

What is "chastened" or "chasteneth" or "disciplined" or "disciplining" (G3811)? Elsewhere it's translated as "learned", "taught", "instructing", "teaching":
"learned"
Acts 7:22: "And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds."
"taught"
Acts 22:3: "I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day."
"learn"
1 Timothy 1:20: "Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
"instructing"
2 Timothy 2:25: "In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;"
"teaching"
Titus 2:11-12: "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;"

The word translated "corrector" (G3810) in Hebrews 12 is found only one other place in the New Testament where it's translated "instructor".
Romans 2:20: "An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law."

Nothing in the Hebrews 12 passage implies any permission at all for parents to practice corporal punishment of young children, much less command it. "Discipline", yes; "spank", no.
Hebrews 12:7-11: "If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."


What is obedience?
The Greek word "obey" G5219 as in "obey your parents" means listen, attend to, or hearken; this is a voluntary compliance, never coerced.  The corresponding Hebrew word H8085 means to listen earnestly, to give attention to, and to consider and respond.  Proverbs 19:20 describes future wisdom as the reason to obey or listen to counsel. Ezekiel 4 shows an example when Ezekiel was neither chastized nor punished for refusing to obey God's command; instead, God gave a modified command, which Ezekiel obeyed happily.  Jesus said that delayed obedience following outright defiance still counts as obedience in Matthew 21. Obedience of children should demonstrate and be practiced within a loving trusting relationship.  Parents are never commanded to extract compliance or force their children to obey.


What about the Proverbs "rod passages"?
Even ignoring the implications of Jesus saying, "but I say unto you," and, "turn the other cheek," the "child" referred to in Proverbs is a sexually-mature young man; modern translations better translate the Hebrew word H5288 "na'ar" as "youth" to show this age distinction.  Even if taken literally, these Proverbs passages about the rod cannot be literally applied to young children as is widely practiced within the church as "spanking" and any other form of corporal punishment; if it could be applied to anyone, it would be to older boys who have reached the age of puberty.
